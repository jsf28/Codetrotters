# The Story: 
###We are going to use our Tilde.io mock-up to play with jQuery

We're going to learn some fundamentals of DOM events and jQuery by adding event listeners to this site.  You'll have a fixed HTML file to work with, and your job is to change the CSS and JS to achieve the desired result.

The `index.html` file in this repo contains all the HTML needed for this project.
The `main.css` file contains all the CSS needed for this project, although you can feel free to add classes, which you can then assign using jQuery.


##Learning Goals

* Writing named functions to encapsulate code
* Using event-listeners to capture a DOM event
* Using jQuery event methods to respond to DOM events

## LAB Objectives:

Edit the `main.js` and `main.css` files to do the following:

* underline the navbar link text when a user clicks on a navbar link
* remove the underline when a user clicks on a *different* navbar link (and add the underline to the newly clicked link)
* hide the rest of the page (everything below the navbar) when the User clicks the `Meet the Team` button
* show the page when the User clicks the `tilde` logo in the nav bar

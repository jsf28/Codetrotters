# The Story: 
###We are going to duplicate http://www.tilde.io/!

We're going to learn some fundamentals about webpage layout by mocking up an existing webpage - <a href="http://www.tilde.io/">http://www.tilde.io/</a>. You'll have a fixed HTML file to work with and your job is to change the CSS *and only the CSS* to achieve the desired layout.

The `index.html` file in this repo contains all the HTML needed for the first part of this mockup project.  Although it doesn't contain *all* content from the original website, it's pretty close, and it's enough for us to play around with.  Do not change this file!


##Learning Goals
Put our new CSS skills to the test by mocking up a real website.

## LAB Objectives:

As closely as you can, edit the main.css file so that the index page now looks like the homepage of Tilde.io, found <a href="http://www.tilde.io/">here.</a>

####BONUS Objectives:

* Using only CSS, create a drop-down menu under the "Services" part of the navbar.  The HTML for this is already present in the `index.html` file, but that portion of the drop-down is currently being hidden with CSS.  *Hint: use advanced CSS selector and the `hover` pseudo-element*
* Incorporate a font that more closely matches the fonts used in Tilde.io by implementing <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">a Google font.</a>

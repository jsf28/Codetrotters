# The Story: 
###Remembering that **each HTML element is a box**, let's use CSS to move things where we want them to go.

We're going to learn some fundamentals about webpage layout. You'll have a fixed HTML file to work with and your job is to change the CSS *and only the CSS* to achieve the desired layout.

The `index.html` file in this repo contains basic HTML for a blog post, including:

* A page header
* A navigation bar
* The blog post content
* A footer

CSS is weird and frustrating for most engineers. The model seems inconsistent and strange at first, but the engineers who master it are treated with awe and reverence.

##Learning Goals
Layout with CSS using positioning and the box model.

##Objectives

As closely as you can, edit the main.css file so that the blog post now looks like this:

`<img>`

* The title of the blog should be centered
* The navigation bar options should be centered and evenly spaced
* The blog article itself should be left-aligned
* The blog article itself should be `600px` in width
* The footer should be at the bottom of the page
* The footer text should have padding on the top and bottom, but no bottom margin
* The footer should span `100%` of the page width

####BONUS Objectives:

* Using *only* HTML, add a Copyright symbol next to the word "Copyright" in the footer
* Make the top title and nav bar "fixed," so that when the page scrolls, the title/nav area stays fixed to the top of the page (on the content scrolls)
* Make the Navbar options links (`a` tags) with the `href` attribute set to `#`.  Create a hover action using CSS, so that when the user hovers over the link, it changes colors.
